# React Testing Library

This project contains Jest and RTL tests for a React application.
The skills developed were:
* Using the selectors (queries) of React-Testing-Library in automated testing.
* Simulating events with the React-Testing-Library in automated tests.
* Testing asynchronous logic flows with the React-Testing-Library.
* Writing tests that allow refactoring of the structure of application components without having to change them.
* Creating API mocks using fetch.
* Test inputs.
